# Write a python program for contact tracing:

# - Display a menu of options
# 	Menu:
# 		 1 -> Add an item
# 		 2 -> Search
# 		 3 -> Exit (y/n)
# - Allow user to select item in the menu (check if valid)
# - Perform the selected option
# 		- Option 1: Ask personal data for contact tracing (Listed are sample only, add more)
# 				   Use dictionary to store the info
# 				   Use the full name as key
# 				   The value is another dictionary of personal information
# 		- Option 2: Search, ask full name then display the record
# 		- Option 3: Ask the user if want to exit or retry.

# Note: 
# - Your program should be uploaded to github before 4pm
# - Record a demo presenting your program
# - Send the demo or link of demo directly to my messenger

# Example Output:

# Menu:
#  1 -> Add an item
#  2 -> Search
#  3 -> Exit (y/n)
